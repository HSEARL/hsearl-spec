## Overview

This repository defines the core semantics, structure, and extension process of the HSEARL framework.

HSEARL is a framework and collection of technologies for building humans in digital spaces.

HSEARL aims to provide a formal specification for modeling:

- **Cognitive Architectures**: Memory systems, attention mechanisms, and decision-making processes
- **Motivational Dynamics**: Need hierarchies, goal pursuit, and behavioral adaptation
- **Environmental Interactions**: Context-aware responses and ecological constraints
- **Temporal Evolution**: Learning, development, and state transitions over time

The purpose of this project is to solve pure tasks in human activities, and does not address academic philosophy, rationale, or accuracy discussions about what it means to be human.

Currently, implementation using LLMs is assumed, and this can be regarded as the necessary framework and technologies for that purpose.

## Project Scope

This specification repository contains:
- **Core Definitions**: [Fundamental concepts and data structures](hsearl)
- **Extension Mechanisms**: How to add new capabilities while maintaining compatibility
- **Formal Schemas**: Data structure definitions and validation rules
- **Design Documentation**: Architecture guidelines and best practices
