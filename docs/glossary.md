# HSEARL Glossary

**Languages:** [English](./glossary.md) | [日本語](./ja/glossary.md)

This document defines key terms and concepts used throughout the HSEARL specification.

## Core Terms

### Agent
An entity implementing the HSEARL framework, capable of cognition, adaptation, and goal-directed behavior.

### Attention Mechanism
The system component responsible for selecting and prioritizing information processing based on relevance and resource constraints.

### Cognitive Architecture
The overall structure and organization of mental processes, including perception, memory, reasoning, and action selection.

### Context
The environmental and internal state information that influences an agent's behavior and decision-making.

### Drive
A fundamental motivational force that energizes behavior towards satisfying basic needs.

### Ecological Adaptation
The process by which agents adjust their behavior and internal models in response to environmental constraints and opportunities.

### Episode
A bounded sequence of experiences stored in memory, typically representing a coherent event or interaction.

### Goal
A desired state or outcome that guides an agent's planning and action selection.

### HSEARL
Human Semantic & Ecological Adaptive Representation Language - the framework for modeling cognitive systems.

### Memory System
The collection of components responsible for encoding, storing, and retrieving information, including working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory.

### Motivational State
The current configuration of needs, drives, and goals that influence behavior selection.

### Need Hierarchy
The structured organization of needs from basic (physiological) to complex (self-actualization).

### Semantic Network
A knowledge representation structure where concepts are nodes and relationships are edges.

### State Representation
The formal encoding of an agent's internal state, including cognitive, motivational, and physiological variables.

### State Transition
A change from one valid state to another, governed by defined rules and constraints.

### Temporal Dynamics
The time-based aspects of cognition, including learning rates, memory decay, and adaptation speed.

### Working Memory
The limited-capacity system for temporarily maintaining and manipulating information during cognitive tasks.

## Specification Terms

### Conformance
The degree to which an implementation adheres to the HSEARL specification requirements.

### Extension
Additional functionality built on top of the core HSEARL specification while maintaining compatibility.

### RFC (Request for Comments)
A proposal document for changes or additions to the HSEARL specification.

### Schema
A formal definition of data structures and validation rules for HSEARL components.

### Semantic Version
A versioning scheme (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) used for tracking specification changes.

## Implementation Terms

### Binding
A language-specific implementation of the HSEARL specification.

### Compatibility
The ability of different HSEARL implementations to interoperate correctly.

### Validator
A tool that checks whether data or implementations conform to HSEARL specifications.
