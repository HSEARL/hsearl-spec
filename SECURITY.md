| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The HSEARL team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### Where to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of these methods:
1. Email: security@hsearl.org
2. GitHub Security Advisories: [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/HSEARL/hsearl-spec/security/advisories/new)

### What to Include

Please include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the issue
- Location of affected code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Varies based on severity

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: Our team will investigate and assess the impact
3. **Communication**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
5. **Recognition**: With your permission, we'll acknowledge your contribution

## Security Considerations for Implementations

### Data Validation
- Validate all input data against schemas
- Implement proper bounds checking
- Sanitize user-provided content

### State Management
- Ensure state transitions follow specified rules
- Implement proper access controls
- Prevent unauthorized state modifications

### Memory Safety
- Use memory-safe languages where possible
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Avoid buffer overflows and memory leaks

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Use role-based access control
- Validate permissions for all operations

### Cryptography
- Use well-established cryptographic libraries
- Don't implement custom cryptography
- Keep cryptographic keys secure

### Network Security
- Use TLS for network communications
- Validate certificates properly
- Implement rate limiting

## Security Best Practices

### For Maintainers
1. Review all code changes for security implications
2. Run security scanning tools
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Document security considerations

### For Contributors
1. Follow secure coding practices
2. Test for common vulnerabilities
3. Document security implications of changes
4. Report issues responsibly

### For Users
1. Keep implementations updated
2. Follow deployment best practices
3. Monitor for security advisories
4. Report issues promptly

## Disclosure Policy

- Security issues are disclosed after a fix is available
- We coordinate disclosure with reporters
- CVEs are requested for significant issues
- Advisories are published on our security page
