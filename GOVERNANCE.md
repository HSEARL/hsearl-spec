# HSEARL Project Governance

This document defines the governance structure and decision-making processes for the HSEARL specification project.

## Project Structure

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Maintainers
- Review and merge pull requests
- Make decisions on RFCs
- Ensure project quality and direction
- Manage releases and versioning

#### Contributors
- Submit patches and improvements
- Propose RFCs for significant changes
- Participate in discussions
- Report issues and bugs

#### Community Members
- Use HSEARL specifications
- Provide feedback
- Participate in discussions
- Spread awareness

### Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have demonstrated:
- Sustained high-quality contributions
- Deep understanding of HSEARL architecture
- Commitment to project values
- Strong communication skills

May be nominated by existing maintainers. Approval requires:
- Nomination by at least one maintainer
- Support from 2/3 of existing maintainers
- No blocking objections within 7 days

## Decision Making Process

### Consensus Model

We strive for consensus on all decisions through:
1. **Discussion** - Open dialogue in issues/discussions
2. **Proposal** - Clear documentation of proposed changes
3. **Review** - Adequate time for community feedback
4. **Resolution** - Address concerns and iterate

### RFC Process

Major changes require an RFC (Request for Comments):

1. **Draft** - Author creates RFC following template
2. **Discussion** - 2-week minimum comment period
3. **Revision** - Address feedback and concerns
4. **Decision** - Maintainers approve/reject
5. **Implementation** - Approved RFCs are implemented

### Voting

When consensus cannot be reached:
- Maintainers may call for a vote
- Each maintainer has one vote
- 2/3 majority required for approval
- Voting period: 7 days

### Fast-Track Process

Minor changes may be fast-tracked if:
- All maintainers agree
- No community objections within 48 hours
- Changes are non-breaking

## Code of Conduct

All participants must follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Violations are handled through:
1. Warning (private)
2. Warning (public)
3. Temporary ban
4. Permanent ban

## Meetings

### Regular Meetings
- Monthly maintainer meetings (first Tuesday)
- Quarterly community meetings
- Meeting notes published within 48 hours

### Special Meetings
- Called by any maintainer
- 48-hour notice required
- Agenda published in advance

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts are resolved through:
1. Direct discussion between parties
2. Mediation by uninvolved maintainer
3. Maintainer team decision
4. Appeal to CNCF (if applicable)

## Changes to Governance

This governance model may be changed through:
- RFC proposal
- 3/4 maintainer approval
- 30-day comment period
- No blocking objections from maintainers

## Attribution

This governance model is adapted from successful open source projects including Kubernetes, Rust, and Node.js, tailored for the HSEARL project's needs.
